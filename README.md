## Overview
Writing cloudformation template to launch 100s of server is boring and cumbersome especially if your environment is already configured. I ran in to a similar situation and looking for solutions I found troposphere(https://github.com/cloudtools/troposphere). Which is python library that lets you generate cloudformation templates programmatically. This script uses troposphere to do the real magic.
